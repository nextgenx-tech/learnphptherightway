# Learn PHP the Rightway
Hello & welcome to my first course "Learn PHP The Right Way". In this course, you will learn PHP from beginners level all the way to advanced. The "right way" is subjective of course, but my goal is to teach PHP the way I would want to learn myself where important topics like security, caching, performance, configuration, routing, dependency management, dependency injection & testing are not omitted even when the course is for beginners.
